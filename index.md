# About Me

  <br>

<img src="" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm Yuhan Li – a pharmacology explorer at Macau University of Science and Technology! In our State Key Lab, I've published two SCI papers on inflammation pathways while actively investigating cerebrovascular and ion channel mysteries.

**My journey extends beyond the lab:**
• Dived into pathology research at Dakewei Biotech
• Decoded clinical pharmacy operations at Shenzhen Yantian Hospital
• Gained frontline pediatric experience at China's top-tier Children's Medical Center

**I've also connected with pharma innovators:**
→ Shadowed R&D teams at Fosun Pharma & By-Health
→ Explored genomics at BGI
→ Discussed AI-drug discovery at XtalPi

Driven to bridge lab breakthroughs with patient impact – let's connect! **[yuhan.app@outlook.com]**
